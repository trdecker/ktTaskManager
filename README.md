# Overview

Basic Task Manager written in Kotlin. I wanted to familiarize myself with the programming language, without the added difficulty of learning Android development (which I also plan on learning later).

The program currently allows the user to create new tasks, edit current tasks, delete tasks, and mark tasks as "complete". The tasks currently aren't saved to a CSV file or in MongoDB, partially because that would be out of the scope for what I was trying to learn.

# Development Environment

Developed using VSCode, written in Kotlin. I used the extensions "Kotlin" by fwcd and "Kotlin Language" by mathiasfrohlich in VSCode to make this possible. In command line, kontlinc was used to create and run the .jar file.

# Future Work
